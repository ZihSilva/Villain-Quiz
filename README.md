# Welcome to Project #1: The Villain Quiz

## About me  üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I am a former preschool teacher living in Vancouver Island, Canada. Even though I am passionate about teaching, I decided it was time to challenge myself to learn something new. I am currently taking a Web Development Bootcamp offered by Ironhack S√£o Paulo and I can not wait to apply all my knowledge working as a Web Developer.

## About the game üí≠
This quiz was created to test the user's knowledge of the most notorious villains from the cinema and also to practice all the skills acquired during the first two weeks of the program.

## How to play? ü§î
 To play, the user needs to click the PLAY button, which leads to the first question. Each question has four options and the player has to choose the correct one.
